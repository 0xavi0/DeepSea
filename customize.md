The individual state files are task oriented and the orchestration calls these on the state files in the desired order on the desired targets.  Every state file and orchestration file can be overridden to include any "missing" steps that an administrator feels is necessary.  Likewise, steps can be disabled completely.  All of this is accessible as text files including the configuration.
