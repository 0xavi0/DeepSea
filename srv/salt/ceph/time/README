Setup ntp to manage system time

Ceph relies on loosely synchronized clocks. DeepSea will by default start an ntp
client on each client and point to the salt master as their ntp server if and
only if the ntpd.service is not yet running.
If you want DeepSea to overwrite and existing ntp configuration set "time_init:
ntp" in the pillar.
To disable all ntp management set "time_init: disabled" in the pillar. Note that
the admin should have some for of time synchronisation set up in this case.
Otherwise Ceph might not function reliably.
